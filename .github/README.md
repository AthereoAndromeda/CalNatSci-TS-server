# CalNatSci-TS-server

A server for [CalNatSci-TS](https://github.com/redstripez08/CalNatSci-TS)

Nothing too special really, it's on its own repo since im planning to use Docker to host bot and
server separately, via `docker-compose` The server is also independent from the bot, with really the only thing linking them
together being the database.
